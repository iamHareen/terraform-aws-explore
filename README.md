# DevOps CI/CD Pipeline for AWS ECR & ECS

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a GitLab CI/CD pipeline that:

* Deploys AWS infrastructure using Terraform (ECR, ECS, and related resources).
* Builds a Docker image from source code.
* Pushes the image to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
* Deploys the container to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).

## Technologies Used

* **GitLab CI/CD**: Automated pipeline
* **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code
* **Docker**: Containerization
* **AWS ECR & ECS**: Container Registry & Orchestration

## DevOps vs. Platform Engineering: A Comparative Analysis

### DevOps: Bridging Development and Operations

DevOps is a **culture and set of practices** aimed at **breaking silos** between development and operations teams. It emphasizes:

* **Automation** (CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code).
* **Continuous Improvement** (feedback loops, monitoring, logging).
* **Collaboration** (shared responsibility for the entire software lifecycle).

**Key Tools**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform.

### Platform Engineering: The Next Evolution

Platform Engineering focuses on **building internal developer platforms (IDPs)** that abstract infrastructure complexities. It provides:

* **Self-service capabilities** (developers can deploy without deep ops knowledge).
* **Standardized tooling** (consistent workflows across teams).
* **Scalability & Governance** (security, compliance, and cost controls).

**Key Tools**: Backstage, Crossplane, Kubernetes Operators.

## üîê The Rise of DevSecOps: Why Security Can‚Äôt Be an Afterthought

### What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps integrates **security practices** into every phase of the DevOps lifecycle from code commits to production deployments.

**The Industry is Shifting Due To:**

* **Expanding Attack Surfaces:**
    * Cloud-native apps (containers, serverless) introduce new vulnerabilities.
    * Example: A misconfigured ECR repository can expose private images.

* **Regulatory Pressure:**
    * GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC2 require proven security controls.
    * DevSecOps automates compliance checks (e.g., Terraform scans for PCI-DSS).

* **The Speed vs. Security Imperative:**
    * Traditional security reviews slow deployments; DevSecOps automates checks without bottlenecks.
